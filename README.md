Each R Markdown file generates the data and corresponding figure (or table) specified in the file name. For example. `Figure1A.Rmd` generates the data presented in Figure1A of the paper.

Note that in order to reproduce the data and figures in the paper (https://figshare.com/s/10bd487952892b5c939a), it would be necessary to have the Beth Israel Deaconeness Medical Center (BIDMC) dataset, which cannot be made public.
